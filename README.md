Swipe2Pop
=========

This category lets you two finger swipe to the right to pop on the navigation controller

##Usage
Just `import "UINavigationController+PopOnSwipeRight.h"` where you initialize your Navigation Controller and you're good to go.

This project is just ARC at the moment. This will be updated soon.
